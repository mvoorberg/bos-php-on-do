* `git reset` can be used to throw out local changes or cancel a failed merge.
```bash
$ ng generate directive show-more
```

These are just some of the git commands I use on a near daily basis. I generally prefer to use the command-line over tools that try to do it all for me as it gives me more control and I get better feedback about the process. 

### Wrap-up
The examples listed above are basic commands and there's a laundry list of options for each one. If you're learning Git on your own or in a team, I'd suggest you create a playground where you're able to try out these commands and see how they behave in real situations. Once you're comfortable with the basics, go ahead and start exploring the options for each of the different commands.
