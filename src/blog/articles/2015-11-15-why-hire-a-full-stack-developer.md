Modern software development has changed a lot from the days where entire apps were written
with UI and business logic in a single code base.
Today there are a lot more layers and it's not simply about front-end,
infrastructure, server-side, and database. Each one of those further breaks down into distinct components.

>####Front-end:
>
> * HTML, JavaScript, CSS
> * May include additional frameworks or libraries
> 
>####Networking & Infrastructure:
>
> * Servers, Load Balancing and CDN's
>
>####Server-side:
>
> * Node.js, PHP, C#, Python etc
> * Depending on the programming language, you're likely dealing with layers here as well
> 
>####Database:
>
> * MongoDB & replica sets, MySql, Postgress etc
> 

In 2009 the first versions of both Node.js and MongoDB were published and with that came the
ability to run JavaScript, not just in the browser, but on the server and in the database as well.
Suddenly, it was possible to write entire web applications in a single programming language.
It's this end-to-end JavaScript environment that prompted term "full stack developer" as it was now possible
to for developers to easily transition from the front-end to the back-end.
 
A full stack developer may not have mastery of every framework or library
but they will absolutely have skills in each respective area. Perhaps the most
valuable skill they will bring to the table is their experience and their proven ability to
solve problems, identify solutions and get things done. They are able to work anywhere
they're needed within the application stack and can provide valuable direction and advice to their peers.
There has always been a need for software engineers with an end-to-end
awareness of their tools and their craft, that's no less true today where systems have become increasingly complex.

Whether your full stack development is JavaScript or otherwise, having a team that knows it's way around
your technology stack will help your team find success and grow your business.
